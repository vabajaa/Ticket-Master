# Ticket Master
---
Ticket Master is now open sourced to help new developers as an example. 
Most code was gutted to ensure user privacy:
* Web Panel
* Custom Bots
* All saved data

Was removed.
## Setup
___
Ticket Master can be setup on a bunch of places, but I mainly recomend [Glitch](https://glitch.com) (Will open in current tab)
